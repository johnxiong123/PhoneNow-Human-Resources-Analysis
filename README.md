# PhoneNow-Human-Resources-Analysis

### Introduction:
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.
This is the third task in the Virtual case experience with PwC. I’ll be reporting to the Human Resources department of PhoneNow about the gender balance in PhoneNow.

### Problem Statement:
Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world.
This task involved the following:
Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, and create a visualization
Write what some root causes of their slow progress might be.

### Recommendations
- More female employees should be considered for promotions to the top leadership levels at least by 10% increase, especially the Director and Executive level in the company to achieve gender balance and inclusion.
- There is an unbalanced distribution based on the gender of employees in the Sales and Marketing department, it is recommended to increase female employees in the Sales and Marketing department by 10% to boost sales results.
- With the sudden number of leavers that was experienced in 2019, it is recommended that the yearly hiring of employees should be monitored in order to substitute for about 10% of possible leavers.
- The ratio of employees that were promoted to those that were previously selected to be promoted was very low as the majority due for promotion were not promoted. It is recommended that the department look into this aspect. Improving these numbers will also promote the retention of employees.
